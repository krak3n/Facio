Hooks
=====

Facio has the ability to run hooks. Hooks are pieces of code that are
run either before or after the project template is rendered.

Hooks are defined on a per project basis and are set in a file which resides
in the project template itself. This file is called ``.facio.hooks.yml``. It is
a ``YAML`` formated file consisting of a ``before`` and an ``after`` list of
python dotted paths to code to run. For example:

.. code-block:: yaml

    before:
      - path.to.foo

    after:
      - path.to.bar

Bundled Hooks
-------------

Facio also has some bundled hooks you can use out of the box.

These will continue to grow and improve as Facio matures further. Currently
there are only ``python`` related hooks.

Django Secret Key
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* **Path**: ``facio.hooks.django.secret``
* **Type**: before
* **Creates Context Variable**: ``{{ DJANGO_SECRET_KEY }}``

For ``Django`` projects a secret key is need to protect your project. Django
generates this for you when you run ``django-admin.py startproject`` for
example. Facio can also do this and add a new variable to the template context.

To use this create a ``.facio.hooks.yml`` file at the root of your project
template and add the following:

.. code-block:: yaml

    before:
      - facio.hooks.django.secret

And in your template you can use the ``{{ DJANGO_SECRET_KEY }}`` variable, for
example the secret key would normally go in ``settings.py``:

.. code-block:: python

    ...
    SECRET_KEY = '{{ DJANGO_SECRET_KEY }}'
    ..

.. _python-virtualenv-hook-label:

Python Virtual Environment Creation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* **Path**: ``facio.hooks.python.virtualenv``
* **Type**: before or after
* **Creates Context Variable**: none

Facio can automatically create a python virtual environment for your project.
Add this hook in either the ``before`` or ``after`` list.

.. code-block:: yaml

    after:
      - facio.hooks.python.virtualenv

Prompts
^^^^^^^

This hook will ask for the following information with sensible defaults set, so
you can just press ``enter`` to skip.

* **Virtual environment name**

  * The name of the virtual environment to create
  * Default: Project Name defined when running ``$ facio``

* **Virtual environment path**

  * Where the virtual environment should be created on your file system
  * Default: ``~/.virtualenvs``

Python Package Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* **Path**: ``facio.hooks.python.setup``
* **Type**: after
* **Creates Context Variable**: none

This hook allows you to install your project as a python module provided your
project has a ``setup.py`` correctly configured in the templates root
directory.

.. note::

    Since your template is required to have been processed before this hook
    can be run you should only define this hook in the ``after`` list of
    ``~/.facio.hooks.yml``.

.. code-block:: yaml

    after:
      - facio.hooks.python.setup

Prompts
^^^^^^^

This hook will ask you for the following information with sensible defaults set
so you can just press ``enter`` to skip.

* **Python path**

  * Path on the file system to the python executable to run ``setup.py``
    against.
  * Default: The current python executable running ``facio`` or if the
    :ref:`python-virtualenv-hook-label` hook has been run it will be the path
    to the virtual environments python executable.

* **install or develop**

  * Install the package onto the python path or install it as an editable
    module
  * Default: ``develop``

Custom Hooks
------------

You can write your own hook if you need to. Your hook will need to meet the
following criteria:

* Be available on your python path so it can imported
* Contain a ``run`` function.

Hello World
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning::

    How to add your custom hook onto the python path is beyond the scope of
    this documentation. If your hook cannot be imported it will not work.
    See http://www.scotttorborg.com/python-packaging/ for a very
    helpful guide on python packaging.

Let's make a simple hook that prints "hello world". Create a file in your home
directory a new directory called ``my_hooks`` and inside create 2 files:

* ``__init__.py``
* ``hello.py``

And add the following content into ``hello.py``.

.. code-block:: python

    def run():
        print 'hello world'

This has created a new python module called ``my_hooks`` and inside we have a
``hello.py`` python file that can be imported containing our ``run`` function.

That's it, now all we need to do is get it on the python path. How to add your
custom hook onto the python path is beyond the scope of this document, see
http://www.scotttorborg.com/python-packaging/ for a very helpful guide on python
packaging.

Accessing State
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Facio has a ``state`` module where the current state of Facio is stored. Simply
import it:

.. code-block:: python

    from facio.state import state

Updating Context
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also add extra context variables in hooks for use in your template.

.. code-block:: python

    # my_hooks.foo

    from facio.state import state

    def run():
        state.update_context_variables({'FOO': 'bar'})

The hook above adds a new ``FOO`` context variable with the value of ``bar`` so
you can use ``{{ FOO }}`` in your templates.

Accessing other hook data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also access returned values from other hooks that have run. This can be
useful to provide sensible defaults in prompts or even to not run the currently
executing hook unless another in the chain has run.

.. code-blocK:: python

    # my_hooks.bar

    from facio.state import state

    def run():
        call = state.get_hook_call('my_hooks.foo')
        if call:
            print 'my_hooks.foo has run'

Saving hook data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As described above hook data can be stored for use by other hooks later in the
chain. To save data all you need to do is have your ``run`` function return
something.

.. code-block:: python

    # my_hooks.baz

    def run():
        return "foobar"

When ``baz`` is called the value ``foobar`` will be stored so later hooks can
use it:

.. code-block:: python

    # my_hooks.faff

    def run():
        print state.get_hook_call('my_hooks.baz')

This will print ``"foobar"``.

Output and Prompting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want your hook to prompt a user for information or print out helpful
colored messages you can extend from the ``FacioBase`` class. You can find
more information about this in the ``API`` documentation.

.. code-block:: python

    # my_hooks.flop

    from facio.base import FacioBase

    class Flop(FacioBase):

        def __init__(self):
            val = self.gather('Enter a number: ')
            self.out('You entered: {0}'.format(val))

    def run():
        flop = Flop()
        return flop

Examples
~~~~~~~~

As mentioned Facio has several bundled hooks, you can use these as templates to
writting your own.
